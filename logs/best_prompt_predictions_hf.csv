"Few people believe that the amount of time children invest in playing electronic games is valuable,while some peoples trust that it really has a bad impact on a child too.In my opinion the children are wasting their precious time if they are getting used to it on a regular basis and it also leaves a bad impact on their well being as well.


In the present world the children spend most of their free time in front of computers mobiles and electronic gadgets rather than going out there under the sun to get involved in physical activites and sports which helps them being fit  in a longer run. The only stress buster after hours of lectures they would have had since morning is the free time they get in the evenings which they despite choose to spend being all alone in front of these gadgets rather one has to go out there and get social with the children of their age so that they can involve in some of the things which keep them fit.


The impact which these leaves on children in future might be far more intense.One gets deprived of the social network and get used to being all alone which does not serve good in the long run. Infact investing long hours in front of them can lead to a child having problems with his eye which is really not appreciated.


Although there are some feeble chances that a child can attain great heights if he/she chooses to make a living out of it by becoming a proffessional gamer it has lead to more negative impact rather than positive ones. Overall if a child is deprived from getting used to those new technologies he/she will have an amazing future a in terms of health if not being actually successful in life but who knows the same amount of time they may invest in developing their career perspectives and achieve a great feet.",4.0,4.5,4.5
"It is argued that it is possible to resolve a part of environmental problems if the cost of fuel for the personal and commercial transport will significantly increase. I particularly agree with this statement and in this essay, I will try to explain why. 

On the one hand, burnable fuel it is the main resource of energy in modern world, and the cost of the fuel has a great impact for the cost of food and goods, hence people try to save their money what extend to conscious consumption of the fuel and more effective logistic ways. Therefore, the fuel economy is decreased amount of the pollution to the environment which has a positive influence on the nature. Moreover, cost of fuel extends to developing of advanced technology and it is a fact that modern cars have a less exhaust of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than earlier. For example, Scandinavian countries stimulate people to keep the fuel economy policy and to have modern vehicles by way to cancellation of taxes to the owners of cars with zero emissions. 

On the other hand, increasing the cost of the fuel in poor countries, could stimulate people to use mo cheaper and dirtier fuel, which only increases air pollution.",3.5,6.5,6.5
"No doubt behaviour represents the personality of an individual assignment of society believe that what children watch influence them and their behaviour while other points that the most amount of time spent on television watching influence pupils behaviour most I would like to delve both the arguments before upsurging and opinion

To begin ,with behaviour is vital for an individual in the society peoples watch a lot of things happening around them in the house and Society all things implement on the People's life and they visualise a lot of stuff in house like the body language of their parents and how their respect each other and show their love and communicate with each other pupils visualised all the things and apply and do an experiment in their own life which affect their life and behaviour and Society is also show both the positive and negative tops which people visualised all around them in the society such as road racing crime steps physical activities and all this type of visualisation affect pupils hence everything pupils visualised around them influence their behaviour

On the other ,hand watching TV influence people most in both ways positive and negative there are a lot of negative effects which affect people's behaviour like they spend a lot of time watching TV shows which affect their eyesight cause it takes a lot of concentration to watch TV and spending a lot of timing watching TV effect to take no interest in physical activities which affect their health and create health issues furthermore there are also positive effects like gaining of knowledge by the Science channel and news channels 

To conclude considering all the points mentioned above it is implicated that the visualisation of staff in society and home influence pupils behaviour and also watching TV has its benefits and bad effects.",6.0,4.0,4.0
"In most countries, teenagers often travel or do a part-time or full-time job for a certain period of time before entering the university. The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.
One of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.
There are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.
In conclusion, even though travelling or doing the job for some period gives an opportunity to have work experience and a small saving, downsides to this is showing an interest for earning money rather than continuing study further.",6.5,6.5,6.5
"Opinions differ on whether or not children’s cooperative spirit is best fostered via team sports at school. Although such a goal can be achieved through team sports in educational institutions, I believe that there are better solutions for children to acquire that quality.

Admittedly, team sports are competitive by nature; therefore, players can enhance their communication skills, which is one of the qualities that many people need in their adult lives. Football players, for example, usually raise their teammates’ spirit when losing by using motivational language so that they can actively continue to participate in the match. In addition, a sense of responsibility can also be nurtured in team-involved sports, which means that players have to be responsible for their own roles within a team. A good example is Nguyen Quang Hai, who is one of the Vietnamese football players, he apologized to his fans and teammates for having not listened to others and had a poor performance as a result last year. 

However, the student’s involvement in team-playing sports is not the best way for them to improve their cooperation skills, as the time to take part in such activities is usually limited, and there are better long-term options at school, especially examinations and projects. Regarding the former, learners can be taught how to listen to their peers. For instance, the teacher can conduct a debate, which requires students to pay attention to their classmates’ opinions before raising their arguments. With regard to the latter, children are encouraged to develop their time management skills when participating in this form of group work, as they need to cooperate with their group mates to complete their projects before the deadline.  

	In conclusion, despite the fact that children can learn communication skills and have a sense of responsibility via team sports, I believe that these benefits are unsustainable due to time constraints in sports participation at school. Meanw",8.0,7.5,7.5
"In the modern world, many people have increasingly paid attention about their house or building, and they also make an effort to find a large amount of information about the house and building. In this essay, I discuss about the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house, and suggest the way to reach materials about them. 

I believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research about the house or building. The most important one is that theses days, a number of people consider their own houses or  buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansiosn by making a sale or purchase them, which means that they believe that their houses could be effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize historical value of their buildings where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get intersted in gaining plenty of stories which the buildings or houses contain, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. 

People who want to know about their own house could utilize many ways to get useful information. The most simple strategy is that just questioning to elder family members, and the neighborhood living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is also pretty efficient way for the people to search copy of a house deed, which is a document specifies the detail of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of thier house or building, they would get the material in public offical or on the Internet. 

In conclusion, when people start to be interested in their house or building for any reasons, they can take various steps to unders",5.0,7.0,7.0
"People have different thoughts about the role and function of museums. I personally believe that museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.
On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a hall is to entertain. The gallery is known as a tourist attraction where exhibits a collection of interesting objects that people want to see. Almost people go to the gallery in their space time when no longer having pressure of work or studying. It leads to the fact that they seem to avoid intake too much education and academic content. It is understandable that museums often emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning.By having interactive activities or games which is quite visually spectacular.
On the other hand, educational function could be seen in the role of museums where shows documentary or objects related to history and culture. Through visiting, tourists tend to discover something new about the history behind the gallery 's exhibits. That is the reason why professional guides are employed and heat sets are offered to support visitors to easily access to detailed knowledge about history, culture, science and other aspects of life.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a good hall should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.",5.0,7.0,7.0
"Pay disparity is a growing concern in many large organizations all over the world. While some people support the idea that top-tier officials should earn higher salaries than other employees, others are against this notion. Both views will be discussed in this essay, though I personally feel that the directors of these companies should be paid higher salaries.

Many people think it is unjustifiable to pay managers a wage that is 10 times more than an employee earning the lowest salary in the company. The reason behind this thought is the member's mindset. They believe that the salary paid should be based on the employee's contribution to the growth of the company and not the position of the worker. They argue that a regular employee works much harder and even does extra hours and hence contributes more than the higher authorities towards the success of the organization. This discretion in salary creates low work loyalty and poor motivation among the staff.

However, these people do not understand that salary is not directly proportional to the amount of work done. The remuneration of the higher authorities is based on competition. The board members set a standard salary for executives on the basis of the carcity of competent managers. Moreover, the manager has a lot of responsibilities. Even though he is a manager, he still has to manage his team, manage different projects, make and submit reports to the higher-ups, etc. Therefore, is it justifiable to pay high compensation to the directors of such organizations.

In conclusion, every employee in a company feels that everyone should be equally paid. But in my opinion, the managers should be paid higher than the others for the proper functioning of the institution.",8.0,7.0,7.0

"In the recent era, the increasing number of vehicles on road is becoming a serious issue. There are multiple reasons behind the uplifting number of wheelers on road.In my coming paragraphs ,I shall shed light on the causes and solutions of traffic congestion.
On the reasons side,the people offenly use their private vehicle for job purpose.The masses hardly use public transport to mobile from one place to another .To illustrate, In big cities the working hours of people are depend upon the need of the companies .So,the human being want to use their own wheelers to go for job .The human beings do not have patience and time to wait for the public transport.Apart from this,
Due to the impact of global village ,the people are much more interested in traveling.The travellers want to use their convienient means of transport to go at various places.
On turning to the measures side,the higher authorities should encourage the masses to use public transport.The government should provide various concession on government means of transport ,so that,it can shift the mind compass of people toward the increase demand of public transport .For example,the higher administration should bless the people with quick and comfortable buses service .With the help of this higher rank service ,the people will choose public transport unquestionably.Moreover,the human body should also believe in sharing the private means of transport .There are multiple ways with which mankind can share their personal wheelers .

"The museums play a vital role in saving valuable artefacts and directly reflect the history of a certain country or a nation by exhibiting stuff, that belongs to the past. However, some people find museums boring and not interesting places at all, therefore, they think that exhibitions ought to be more fun. While others convince that museum is the only place for education. This essay argues with the second thought and will discuss both views.

Firstly, redeveloping the historical places to the entertainment facilities will affect the number of interested in learning history. In other words, the subject called history and all things that are connected to this - makes people bored. However, the correct approach to teaching might change the old attitudes. For instance, if our government and teachers were to review the method of educating history, it would positively affect the students' treatment. Making the process of education more enjoyable is a good way to both spend leisure time and learn new about history.

On the other hand, the main purpose of  history is to look at past experiences and learn a lesson along with trying not to make the same wrong decisions in the present, thus, converting museums into entertainment places will devaluate them. Initially, historical places are made for sharing and saving important information, not for having  fun. To illustrate, if  society perceives those places with  joy, the value of the past will significantly decline. In my opinion, it should be taken seriously, accordingly, the primary aim of museums is to educate.

In conclusion, this essay has discussed both views, such as changing  attitudes by introducing the joy and the initial purposes of the historical places. From my point of view, museums ought to remain the same, besides, their aim must be to educate, not have fun.",8.0,7.0,7.0
"There are argumentative conceptions heating up a debate over the fact that human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. While some claim that it is too late to do anything, the opposite makes a statement that we should take action immediately to revamp the situation. 

Obviously, there is a large number of reasonable reasons to demonstrate the conception that we are too late in securing flora and fauna sorts of species from people's reckless occupations. In this day and age, along with urban-sprawl and overpopulation is the phenomenon of swarming lands, which gives rise to the ever-growing demand for open areas to live. As a consequence, in recent years, deforestation has taken place horrendously all over the world due to greed for lands and woods to consume. Those destructions on a mass scale cause loss of habitats for plants and animals in wildlife, put them at risk, and more significantly is pushing numerous classifications of species on the brink of extinction. For instance, the clearest evidence is panda species in China, which has been recorded in the Red Book with an alarming threat of extinction, is a victim of severe deforestation. Hence, great quantities of people believe that it is too late to save plant and animal species from humans’ harmful activities.

While the grave sequels of human disadvantageous activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, the remedies to amend these issues still linger. Notwithstanding the traumatic truth that innumerable forests are terribly damaged, which drags on pushing a great number of plants and animals on the edge of extinction, we can still fix it and we have to take effectual action at this time. Conservation areas ought to be constructed as soon as possible to create sheltered environments for plants and animals, especially species in jeopardy.

"In the midst of this technology-driven global world, multimedia is widespread among the present generation, both adults and children. While films and video games are informative and mind-relaxing to some, many convey violence-containing content, that needs to be unpublished in the opinion of a part of the public. This essay will discuss both these views and I will give my opinion by the end.

First and foremost, in this busy society, people find hardly any time to spend in front of the tv and computers. They are more or less mind refreshing after a long stressful work. For example, many people like to listen to music,  watch favourite movies or play games to soothe their mind and relax their body. These stress relievers help to balance a person's overall mental stability.

Secondly, most programmes contain scenes of abuse, and cruelty, without which they might be incomplete. In the present, the crime rates are more when compared to the past. This can be co-related with the influence of inappropriate programme content that adults or children look into. For example, suicide is a common factor seen among  school-going children nowadays. For instance, there are very few who are not educated, hence they can differentiate between good and bad. Even after many scan proofing, these contents may adversely after the upcoming community.

To conclude, in my opinion, media which is more informative with less violent shows should be encouraged for a better future for people of all age groups.",6.5,6.5,6.5
"Having a child is a mutual decision which involves a lot of planning. A lot of pupils make a conscious decision of wanting to have children in their late age compared to couples in the past who had them early. This essay will discuss the advantages having a baby early as the parents would be financially stable and have ore time to spend with the child, but also highlight the disadvantages of being dependent on a child at their early age and difficulties in having a baby. In my opinion, the pros in this scenario are far more advantageous than the setbacks.

Firstly, as financial stability in most cases comes at a later part in life, having a baby then would be easier for both the infant and the parents. For example, Vivek and Prerna were already earning a handsome amount which made it easier for them to cater to the needs of the baby. Secondly, as they were at a higher position in the corporate ladder, the working hours were lesser which helped them in having more time to spend with their newborn. As the child grows, a parent's responsibility towards their new family member only increases and the aforementioned factors help in making the journey easier.

However, there are also a few disadvtanges in this scenario. At a later age of the female, there are high chances of having complications whilst giving birth to a child. For example, Susan who was 38 at the time, used to have massive pain for which her hospital visits were regular during her pregancy. Furthermore, by the time the child completes his teenage years, the parents are already dependent on them. For example, Ram was only 18 when his parents retired and were dependent on him after it. But these are factors that can be controlled if planned earlier and can be avoided.

To summarise, the benefits of being compensated money wise and not tied to work has its perks, but one shouldn't completely ignore the downsides of the same either. In my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",5.0,7.0,7.0
"In this contemporary era, most   people consider luck as a key factor, which enables them to attain better outcomes, whereas others vehemently reckon that hard work , persistent efforts and skill are the main factors behind one's victory. From my perspective, fortune can only guarantee short-term  success and therefore a paramount significance of being industrious, mentally agile can never be overlooked.

To embark with, apparently, Prosperity only comes to those who have indefatigable spirit, talent, determination, mental strength to go through tough times. Many of the examples could be seen on the front cover of Forbes Magazine. An explicit example could be Ratan Tata, Former chairman of TATA GROUP, who had a strong vision to expand his empire internationally and thereby displayed the courage of conviction by taking over British brands like Jaguar and Land Rover, hence achieving his dream of becoming a global leader in the automobile industry. Therefore, it is evident that nothing comes by chance, we need to work meticulously every day to convert our dreams into reality. if the theory that luck is the main precursor behind success true, by now more than ninety per cent of the masses would have been prosperous. But in real life do we see a plethora of people successful? Certainly no.

Besides this, it is pertinent to mention that goddess of fortunes may bless us with only short term achievements and chiefly it is like a gamble. Suppose  a group of students have not studied anything for examination and on the day of the exam, they went to the temple and prayed  for triumph in front of God . Now these prayers might work once but not always. They may be able to clear one exam by chance,

however in further life, they will face a myriad of impediments. So, destiny is a questionable matter and relying on it entirely would be an infeasible approach for future endeavours. Thus luck is simply a minute factor and depending on it will be a short-sighted practice, which",6.5,7.5,7.5
"Many claimes that the most effective way to become successful in careers is studying at university or college. However ,some people opine that by merely finishing courses at school we can get work.From my point of ,view, I believe learning subjects at university is the best route to find a suitable occupation and become successful.

Firstly ,in my ,opinion, the most significant method to find an appropriate opportunity for getting a high_poweful job is studying in an educational centre. For example ,there are multiple workshops besides courses in order to face different challenges at the workplace. Also ,these could help to solve the problems related to a particular job. This would create  enough knowledge as well as obtain experience in an educational environment. Therefore ,this makes it clear why learning fields at colleges or universities is one of the most important means to become a skilful workforce.

By contrast ,some  people  believe that learning diverse themes in school is adequate to get a job. To  give a clear example ,in most countries around the world there are numerous works that do not need to study higher education at universities such as carpentry , fishing and mechanical works. These people believe theory education is not  a necessary instrument to become thriving in careers but deriving practical experiences is the most essential thing. This would create a noticeable speed to clime the career lather in works without wasting time besides money to conduct a training course in educational centres. As a result ,it becomes apparent this is not required to learn these subjects in a class or workshop. Especially occupations that need to attain experience.

To summarise ,I completely believe that learning at university could cause being flourishing ,however, we can not ignore the importance of obtaining practical knowledge. It is predicted that  by studying and training different courses  the human knowledge will continue to rise to prepare for becoming",8.5,6.5,6.5
"Some believe that illegal Internet loads are having a downside effect on music artists. Others think that they have no effect on artists. In this essay, I will discuss both views and suggest my opinion.

Nowadays, people can get everything they want by surfing the Internet. Even we can watch the latest movie, and download the latest hit music from any site. For example, iPhones have apple music that consumers can buy artists' albums, but sometimes people think why pay for a subscription when can download from illegal sites without any charge? 

Hence, illegal internet downloads are harsh for artists' legal authority, they are selling their products on legal platforms but illegal platforms are just streaming their hard work for free.In my opinion, illegal internet downloads do have a negative impact on the music industry, if people want  their favourite artist's music they should pay for it, this way it's fair for both sides.

On the other side, some feel that illegal loads have little impact or no impact on artists.I wouldn't agree with this perspective. For example, recently some famous artists' albums got leaked before the release date, and all the fans had listened to the entire album, even memorized lyrics, due to that artist releasing his album before the official date.These kinds of incidents happen to most artists. I think illegal downloads have negative effects on the music industry.

In conclusion, day by day illegal internet download is growing, some say it has negative effects on the music industry, while others feel it doesn't have much effect at all. Almost all people have a smartphone that has a legal music platform on it, people should pay for the music they want to listen to. If not, the back side of the story, the artists' copyright would lose its license.",7.0,6.5,6.5
"Some say that publicity causes positive economic effects, while others would argue that announcements are bad for society since they will make people feel unsatisfied with what they are and what they have. This essay will argue that although advertising captures consumers’ minds, a company’s economy will increase.

On the one hand, all publicity will exaggerate how is the product and try to tell the consumers that their product is the best, and they should have it. This is a way of getting more clients, but sometimes the advertising uses incorrect words and expression to persuade people to buy their products, which harms individuals' heart, and make them doubt  themselves  if they are really  what the announcement says. For instance, there are many announcements that  say that the ones who are watching the advertising are nothing,  they need to consume the company’s product to make the individual happier and have a higher social status. However, I believe that this is easy to solve  since most people know what the companies are trying to do, and they are very self-confident, so are not affected by what others say.

On the other hand, companies will invest in advertisements so they can reach more people. This is because almost everyone will use their mobile phone to watch social media, and if companies insert publicity in these pages, more people are able to know the company and the products they sell. Even though maybe at the time they do not need to buy products,  people will remember the announcement and can search for it in the future. Also, now all social media have a technology that knows what the user likes and what you need, so they will recommend related products. This will cause an increase in the company’s economy. For instance, people using Instagram can watch several advertisements when watching the histories and photos uploaded by their friends, also the application has a dedicated tab for sales. I believe that advertising products allow more indivi",6.5,7.0,7.0
"Our mother Earth is currently facing a lot of environmental concerns. Some people believe that by increasing the fee of fuel we would be able to resolve these issues. In my opinion, it may help to some extant, however,this is not the only solution to clear up this problem.To begin with, people from driving their cars release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment.That is, increasing the price of has can help make people run their own vehicles less often and this change forms the air much cleaner.However, this turn will not stop environmental concerns. Moreover, hiking the price of the fuel will affect weak and middle class family.Yet, another compelling reason against the statement is that, people can handle and lessen environmental problems by some better quick fixes. A good illustration of this is, using renewable sources instead of non-renewable resources would be an appropriate way. For example, solar power is an efficient substitute for gasoline.Furthermore, improving public transportation and encourage people to use them is another practical solution.To put it differently, the capture attraction of people to travel by bus or train.For instance, encourage people to adopt public transportation by decreasing the cost of tickets.Not only will it eliminate air pollution, but it also helps to reduce traffic jam.To conclude, considering the points discussed above, the most rational conclusion to be drawn is that, the hike in the petrol price is not the best solution to this problem. Investing in renewable energy sources and improving the efficiency of public transport is a better alternative that ought to be considered.",6.0,7.0,7.0
"In today`s contemporary world, we are living in the capitalist time, where one of the most popular issues is the environment. The topic will be elaborated and a particular opinion will be provided. 

 

 

Undoubtedly, environmental damage is supposed to be a crucial today`s problem, because a lot of pollution can be seen in most countries. For instance, air pollution, water pollution, soil erosion and the like, all those features are harmful for our environment. Nevertheless, there are solutions for this problem. I reckon that governments should take responsibility and officials should cancel permit for factories which pollute the environmental. For instance, The Netherlands' government has issued a new regulation saying that factories which damage our environment should be closed and factories producing toxic gas was closed. Nowadays, Holland is by far the cleanest country in the Europe. 

 

On the other hand, environmental pollution is not one problem. Deforestation  is supposed to be one of the major problems in most countries. Deforestation wipes out local animals, such as owls, rabbits and volves. The government should fix it, because deforestation has a harmful impact not only on our environment but on our health. If the government adds some regulation about deforestation, we will save animals living in the forests. Hence, we will less damage local environment. For example, Germany used to have deforestation, Nonetheless, the government of Germany managed to fix it.    was able to fix this issue/problem
To sum up, I strongly believe that a lot of countries have a big problem with the environment and I wish the government would fix it, as soon as possible, like the above countries have done.",5.0,6.0,6.0
"When there are good quality education nations dominantly flourish ethically as well as  technologically which help to boost state wealth and create an ideal society. It is thought by many individuals that the basic aim of the institution is to make youngsters fine residents and professionals instead of giving them an advantage personally. I would argue in the favor of the mentioned statement and will further explain the reasons behind this.

There are many reasons to support this notion. To begin with, For teens the first learning place as a learner are academies. Since children are being started edification at a very early age, which is the finest period for them to pick the positive and negative aspects of the surrounding easily. Furthermore, They will always go with the same thoughts throughout  life as this era is the best for their mental grooming. To illustrate, According to my country local survey, 80% of the people who are keener to follow laws are universities graduates.

Secondly, The other reason for concurring with this statement is, As institutes are using modern pedagogy along with brand new techno appliances for practical work. Moreover, these teaching methods allow them to learn new developments in science and using this modern equipment make them more skilful and well rounded. Additionally, such people could go easier in their professional careers later on. To cite an example, the National University of science and technology, Pakistan is using modern lab experiments during academic tenure,devoting 70% of the workforce to the multinational companies functioning inside the country compare to other state institutions.

To sum up, I completely agree with this statement that the main purpose of educational institutes is to make  teenagers good dwellers and prepare excellent personal. This is due to schools being the early place for children to be interacted with and these tuition centres are using modern teaching ways to create a workforce. Given ",9.0,6.5,6.5

"Knowing about the history of the home that they reside in has become increasingly common among many people in some places around the world. This essay will suggest that this is due to the curious nature of the human kind and further states that people can become more aware about the past by simply surfing the web, followed by a reasoned conclusion.

The main reason for the raising interest in finding out more about their living place is because of  the deeply rooted curiosity. Men, who are well known for their information seeking behaviour  are set on a mission to find out more about their past, ancestory , rich heritage , culture and so on. For Instance, according to an article by the Indian Express, 7% of Indians are more indulged in finding out about their living place than before.

Many can research and learn important facts about their building by the touch of a botton. In other words, the internet serves as a powerful tool in providing such data since the technology has been developed enough to incorporate valuabe information from the past and the present. For example, the landsape of the place before the condo was built, the families who have resided there and any other incidends in particular can be looked up online.

"There is no boubt that these days the climate is chnging a lot, beacuse  the human and government makes many action impact on the weather. The question is, can we find a way to live with this argument?. In this essay i am going to explain my view and draw my personal conclusion.

In tearms of some reasons which makes climate chang. Firstly, is a global warmaing. The globel waming become beacuse man's activities. When the human bulding the factory in area has many trees and population , the smok from the factory  hurts the atmosphere. Also, if the countris have traffic crowded, the soke from car also impacts on the climate. secondly, the carbon dioxed produced  by gases or fossil fuels , it is the maen reason to increased the globel warming and temperature degrees. So, the individual should be cooprate on reduce of carbon rate by limiting the use of their vehicles and consming energy in factores.

More over, the globel warming will be dangerous in future. To illustrate, the increaseing on temperatue hurts plants and makes the ice is melting. That is mean, the level sea is rising in neare future and the is didn't a good news to our lives, beacuse the most cities are close to sea and oction. So, when level sea incrasing, many flooding will happen.

"It is believed that money ought to be disbursed on forming new public settings, for instance, museums and town halls as distinct from the renovation process of the current buildings. In my opinion, the public finance should be allocated to both the renovation and the creation of cultural areas as they are valuable assets of a city independently of the mode of existence. 

Governments should pay attention to conserve historical museums, regional areas or other buildings, as they are vital for a country to attract tourists. Some of them are successfully doing it through restorative methods. Conversely, others who do not have any remnants of historical places are obliged to create new ones. Take for instance, the United Arab Emirates are constructing hundreds of buildings every year to develop its nation culturally, and thus it is one of the most visited country in its region. 

European countries have many renovated museums and halls, and this gives a feeling as you were in a time tunnel. However, newly constructed buildings are also successful at transmitting the ancient texture of that city to visitors. In terms of costs, the renovation can be by far more expensive than the construction of a new one, yet rich countries will overcome this problem easily. 

In conclusion, public settings play an important role in the cultural development of the nation, and thus they are highly preferred tourist attractions. I believe that, money should be spent on both of them. Rich countries may allot more funds for the restoration, while poor ones have to focus on building these with spending the least amount as possible.",7.0,7.0,7.0
"In today's modern world, money and appearance are one of the main things to be popular while achievements become less 

important. Moreover, this trend might be an awful instance for a new generation. I agree with this statement due to the fact that a huge salary becomes the main aim for students which is a bad habit. This essay will elaborate on the reasons why this motion is terrible. 

The achievements become lessness for plenty of people which has a poor effect on education and science. The main reason

 this community does not pay attention to how much power and energy celebrities spend to achieve their wealth. Furthermore, a huge part of stars does not tell about their hard way which provides students the idea that social status is easy to reach. As the result, many students become lazier and drop their education which as result makes the progress of technology

slower.

 

Besides, appearance and wealth start to be the main purpose of youth which makes them more selfish and unhappy. On top of that, the cause of that is money allows people to purchase everything that makes life more comfortable and easier. Also,with glamour, they guess that everyone would love them and their life would be happier. However, many of them become more lonely due to their traits which were gained by competition for money and popularity.

In conclusion, this trend has an awful impact on young people such as producing students with terrible habits and traits.

 In addition, that movement demonstrates a bad influence on education and technology since the students suppose that achieve high social status is lightweight and as the result, they do not spend much time on education.",6.0,4.5,4.5
"These days, there are more and more learners are inclined to have focus and attention difficulties during the class-hours. This is mainly because of the lack of interest to the subjects and also digital destruction. There are a number of solution that could be implemented to help them motivated.

Firstly, the foremost reason for the students are not actively involved or participating in the learning process, is due to the material uninteresting. In other words, the learners might find some lessons are boring and irrelevant to their live, which causing the struggle to stay engaged and focused.  Some recent studies reported that most students nowadays seek for practical-subjects in which they could feel, touch, and experience through their activities. Secondly, the use of technology in the classroom is also owing to the increased of distraction. As a result, many schoolchildren may be tempted to use their devices for non-academic purposes such as games, social media, and others.

There are two effective solutions to the problem of lack engagement students in learning. One way to tackle this is by having varied teaching methods that related to the real-word applications. For instance, rather than learning to memorize technical terms or definition, students can explore more or doing experimental studies in the laboratory or school garden. Another method to dealing with students’ interest is by immersing them with something they eager for, computer and hand phone, which attract them more, can be a source of learning flat form during the lesson, but still with a clear policy.

In conclusion, it obvious that by providing practical lessons with enjoyable learning activities and adjusting technology as well are seem to give a solution to this notions. If the stakeholders could implement this, learners will be more pleasant to learn in the future.",4.0,6.5,6.5

There is a lot of arguments that why people want to finish their tertiary school. Firstly, a number of people would like to become a doctor, engineer and other fields. In which is essential part of our life to dream come to true.  If a member of society to complete their listen then they don’t have any problem to get a job For instance amazon, people which are interesting in a getting job than they will have to show their degree.

"Some cultures have a belief that younger family members should be responsible for elders in the family by law once they no longer have enough strength to look after themselves in both physically and mentally ways. This has become a controversial issue. From my point of view, I am disagreed with this idea and reckon it should not be made legal. The reasons for my argument will be explained further in the following paragraphs before the conclusion is reached.

At present, there are some segments of society who think that it is a necessary job for descendants to take care of the elderly when they become physically and mentally weak. However, I strongly disagree with this, not with the fact that pupils take care of elders but with the belief that it should be made legal. I always think that it is a good deed for youth to look after their family members, but this should be an optional choice. Everyone has their own right to choose whether they want or do not want to do something. 

Furthermore, it is found by one of the surveys that some people, including young ages, are not ready to hold others' lives in their hands because they are still struggling with their own lives. For instance, think about a person who works all day and night but is still surrounded by problems such as financial, working, and educational issues. Therefore, it would be best for these people to look after their family members when they are ready or it would give them more burden.

In conclusion, even though some populations believe that the younger members of the family should be legally responsible for the elderly, I disagree with this and think that everyone must have the right to choose. Hence, it should not be made as a legal law but should be an optional choice. The offspring must look after others when they think they are ready and do not have any other burden.",7.0,6.5,6.5
"These days , trends have been gone towards the territory findings. In many states, a huge number of people are keenly concerned to discover the history of their residents. This essay will discuss the reasons behind it and will also suggest some  methods to find out the motive. 

There could be many reasons behind the fact that people enquire about their residential areas. While individuals spend a lot of investiture to own a property and the other reason could be the concerns  one could consider before finalising it. For instance, if there is a criminal record of the area such as murder or any other mishaps happened, one would take care in future or restrains from such dwelling. This tells us about the rationale for the chronicle  of the building. 

The history of the house could be found  either by searching the internet or by asking  the neighbours. This ensures valid information as they have been living there for a couple of years . Moreover, any article or documentary related to that specific building could be easily searched. For illustration, the neighbourhood provides the best details and facts , as they have been living there and could have   experienced  some incidents and heard about the statistics.

In conclusion, more and more people want to ascertain the area they are living in because they want to take some precautions before investing a huge amount. Surfing the internet and interviewing the people nearby, can provide adequate facts and figures about that particular household.",8.0,6.5,6.5
"In This day and age, technology has brought significant change in humanity's lives.Few Masses think that children's attitude is changed by box broadcasted.Another segment society says that spending excessive turn is responsible for altering children's behaviour. So I intend to explore that influence of both statements along with my point of view.
To regard with one school thought that.Firstly,it is true that audio is broadcasted many things which are, some reliable and some are unnecessary as well as it has negative and positive outcomes.So, therefore, youth always does limitation of actions which are telecasted on television, even these scenes are related to hand washing steps, good diet although its about dangerous stunt, luxurious life and so on. As a result, through this practice, children can make their future better or ruin.
Moving further with another segment believes that the past plays crucial role in everyone's life so people should use it wisely.Thus, if teenager spent a lot of points in front of the station, they may become irritable and disturbed.Which act as a rude or misbehaviour with their elder ones.As a ramification, they cannot make a strong relationship with their family members. Moreover, they can distract from study due to spending too much moment while watching video instead of pay attention to the study. As a consequence, they cannot obtain high grades in final exams which put negative impacts in order to cannot find good jobs.
In conclusion, I restate that station gives many more valuable things with few unessential actions. Therefore, parents should keep eyes on their children's activities by this they may adopt very good habits.",6.0,4.5,4.5
"Most individuals advocate that a large void between the age of adults and children is advantageous. However, I believe that a greater age difference betwen the kids and elders have way more drawbacks than its positive aspects. I will explain how it affects relations and how it is good for children's learning.

To start with, the generation gap plays a significant role in holding families together. The mentality and lifestyle of the people change as per time and if there is more difference of it in generations, then the relationships will become more hard to remain stable. Thus, it results in splitting families apart. For example, in our neighborhood, there are old parents who has their offsprings quite younger and they could not coupe up with the way their children living. Therefore, all of their children left them alone. Inspite of this, if the age variance is less, then the families will be expected to have healthy relations and better understanding.

However, a small difference in the age of elder and younger ones in families incredibly help the children excel in their academic and professional careers. To explain further, a person's knowledge and experience should be up-to-date in this advanced technology era and if the parents are not too older their kids, then it becomes obvious that they will assist to compete in the face-paced world. For instance, younger couples are nowadays focusing on teaching their children about the computer and technology by being their mentors. 

To conclude, the large generation gap sometimes becomes hindrance in the child'd journey to success in terms of not supporting their ideas. The age-gap plays a major role in defining the strength of relationships among the family and the exposure of the children. As mentioned above, less the difference, more is the understanding and affection between adults and youngsters. Therefore, I believe that the disadvantages of great generation gap having more weigtage than the advantages.",5.5,6.5,6.5
"People have different views on the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.

On the one hand, it can be argued that a museum's primary role is entertaining. Museums are tourist attractions and their goal is to display a collection of interesting objects which many people will want to see. the common visitor can become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content. So, museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This kind of museum is designed to be visually spectacular and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.  

On the other hand, some argue that museums should focus on education. The purpose of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually,  this means that the history behind the exhibitions of the museum needs to be explained and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that other visitors can listen to detailed comments on the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science, and many other aspects of life.

in conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that everyone can have fun and learn something at the same time.",6.5,7.5,7.5
"An essential aspect of the country's overall development is the proportional distribution of its people by age. In many nations, the number of young residents under the age of 15 has increased dramatically and this has had detrimental impacts on society, the labour force and the country as a whole.

The development has the consequence of increasing competition in schools. Due to the intense virally, it will be difficult for parents to reputable schools since the majority of the younger generation needs to attend those educational institutions. Many poor parents, consequently, will be obliged to send their offspring to work to earn sufficient money at a young age, which will exacerbate the exploitation of child labour in many developing and underdeveloped countries. A further drawback is that the age disparity in these nations will result in a shortage of professional and qualified labourers. In industries, such as medicine, construction and aviation, that require a great deal of experience; it is difficult for children to produce exceptional discoveries due to their lack of competence and long-term experience.

However, despite the aforementioned negative repercussions, this propensity is not necessarily a burden. The youth, in my opinion, can support the community through their creativity, responsiveness and inquisitiveness. Considering this trend's ramifications, I feel it will be economically advantageous. In reality, many nations are in desperate need of ample people resources to perform manufacturing and building work. Countries with an enormous number of adolescents will contribute significantly to the countries' human resources, which not only boosts the domestic economy but also attract foreign's investments. In addition, young individuals are frequently energetic and sensitive to new technologies, therefore, I believe that the trend of the young population will assist the country in absorbing new initiatives and effectively implementing them in the host nat",8.0,7.5,7.5
"Although it is often claimed by some folks that  starvation and destitution can only be eradicated by  economic development, other people sometimes argued that the rapid rise of the economy may hamper the climate which needs to be stopped. In my opinion, despite having a few negative impacts on our environment, I think that  economic growth is an inevitable factor for ending the food crisis and poverty.

To begin with, the economic indicators of a nation improve with the development of the financial condition of a country. In other words, since employment generation, an increase of purchasing power, and the rise of disposable income of citizens are improved, people can spend more money in purchasing foodstuffs, and they can similarly save money for future use. For example, Even though Bangladesh faced famine and economic crisis several time  earlier, nowadays people have sufficient crops and grains with the improvement of the economy. Thus, improvements in financial indicators help to remove the impoverishment and food shortage among the people.

On the other hand, the surroundings and biodiversity of an area may be negatively influenced by the development of the economy. Water, soil, and air can be polluted severely from the industrial emissions and throwing of toxic substances as more and more industries need to be established for  economic expansion. For instance, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has recently been recognized as one of the top contaminated city in the world with the advancement of its economy. Therefore, environmental issues of a country may be often required to be compromised in order to ensure the growth of the economy. 

In conclusion, it is a debatable issue whether people should emphasise  economic progress, or  should protect the environment. In my opinion, the reduction of starvation and impoverishment is far more crucial for a country. However, environmental compliances should also be followed meticulously in order to protect the wo",9.0,7.0,7.0
"People have contrasting views about what would be the ultimate goal of an educational institution. While some people opine that school should prepare their pupils as a productive member of society, I think they also should help these children to grow as a person meanwhile.

Firstly, preparing children for employment will ensure their livelihood. If youngsters are provided market-based lectures & environments on their campus, it will create their base for professional life. Consequently, they will be competent by gaining the required knowledge and skills for being recruited by companies or start entrepreneurship. Thus, getting ready for future jobs at an early age helps the children to grasp opportunities in the future and earn their bread and butter. For example, in Bangladesh, the employment rate is 30% higher for the candidates who had graduated from the vocational training centre compared to general.

However, developing children's personality will make them a happy person. An individual may be very successful in life by having a progressive career, yet he may be unhappy and depressed for other internal concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on child cognitive development and improvement of their interpersonal skill so that they could be able to make effective communication, differentiate right and wrong & tackle difficulties. As these young people spend a long time in school, soft skills would be effectively inculcated by them if they are being taught these in the classroom. For instance, punctuality and discipline, two vital qualities a pupil learn from their classroom, which benefits them life-long.

In conclusion, whether making students for future occupations or better characteristics should be the main target of an educational institution is a controversial issue. I think both should be the purpose of a teaching centre for building a complete personality.",9.0,7.5,7.5
"Nowadays, the public is very excited to know their past and history. It is certainly true that more numbers of persons in some nations are very keen to know about the historical value of the place where they live and grow up. There are many causes of it. I have given my justification below.

One of the reasons could be due to maintaining the value of their custom, culture and rituals. In other words, they want to sustain the image of their ancestors in society. Secondly, they need to keep the high integrity, and moral values of the place to show a glimpse to the current generation. As a result, this might help our youngsters to know how this house or building is valuable for them and what is the history behind it. Thirdly, it represents the memory, blessings, goodwills and wishes of elderly people who passed their most of their time in the same house. 

Nevertheless, people can research  history in various ways. First of all, they can explore  past records, and updates and meet the other elderly people who live nearby them. Apart from this, they can access the relevant information through newspapers, community centres or government offices. Furthermore, someone can also visit the nearby municipal corporation department to know the details of the buildings. As per research conducted by a few universities in the world, more than 60% of people are exploring the details of their own houses by contacting the authorities.

To conclude,  it is a general trend currently going on to get  information about the home or place where they live. I agree that these activities will subsequently increase and more and more people will follow the path in order to know their past heritage and relation to the present time.",7.0,7.0,7.0

"Knowledge of the place you live in, be it a country, a city, or just a building, was always important. And now, it is becoming even more popular to learn the history of the house where you live. The reasons for this may be different. Some people are just inspired by all these horror films, and some want to learn something new during the restrictions of Covid 19. There are many potential sources to investigate, from neighbours and previous renters to city archives and old papers.

Folk was always excited about the past. What could be more interesting than going deep into the story of a ghost which, according to the rumours, used to live in your current apartment? Each year there is a new hit, a film, or a book, based on our fear of the unknown and paranormal, and usually include an old dark building - the heart of the horror. Well, this was one reason why people became interested in their houses. Some want to explore the world around them, which is a bit hard to do because of the current epidemic situation. The world of many became so small, and still, it is full of the unknown.

People use different sources to get the information they want. The easiest way is to question neighbours, especially the old ones or previous renters. Some may tell the whole store by themself or give the right direction at least. The other way is to work with documents, such as public city archives or old papers. In the end, it might become a full-scale investigation that may take years and years. For example.

"It is assumed that occupations will be overtaken by robots in the near future. However, I think that, to some extent, menial jobs will be done by the intelligence machines but human intervention would still be necessary for certain jobs. This essay will discuss and differentiate the types of work that can be done by robots or not.

To begin with, Robots will replace all human workplaces which require less effort. Many companies will switch to a robotic workforce because it will be far less expensive than hiring and training a human. In Dubai, for example, numerous shops have automated cashier systems. In addition, these automated billing systems run 24/7 and does not require holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, unskilled jobs will definitely be substituted by automatic computers in the future.

Conversely, there are certain sectors of work that can never be handled by artificial technology. Sectors such as psychology, education, medicine and social work will always require ‘human touch’. For instance, a robot can never be used in a school or a college for teaching because teachers have to explain in different ways depending on the student’s understanding. This is why certain fields of work will never be computerized or automated.

In conclusion, it is a higher possibility that a significant number of jobs will be conducted by artificial intelligence in the future. While, simple tasks will completely be done by robots, human brilliance and attention would still be necessary for a sophisticated field. Ultimately, only a few jobs will be left for humans in an increasingly transforming technology of artificial intelligence.",8.5,7.0,7.0
"In our modern society, many things which may have taken our parents hours, or even days, to complete, we expect to be achieved with near instant speed. The causes of this shift are driven by a growing scarcity of free time, created by longer work hours and a wider range of tasks to complete. I believe that this expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing, however the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly is.

The main reason for why we expect things to occur in a short timespan is that people work longer hours, making their spare time scarcer. Additional hours spent at work mean there are fewer available to accomplish personal tasks, driving a preference for faster completion. For example, it is normal in many jobs for one to work beyond the standard 37 hour work week. I usually work from 40 to 60 hours each week. With fewer hours to spend waiting for services to be completed, or to receive information updates, we, as a people, tend to select speed over most else. This drive for expediency created by time poverty definitely seems like a negative byproduct of our busy lives.

In addition to having less personal time, it seems that people have more things to do in general. Our modern lives carry all of the demands of the previous generation, however there are now also social media, fitness classes, taking children to multiple activities, etc. Given that we have more tasks to complete in less time, the expectation is that these items should be done faster, otherwise one is faced with a mathematical impossibility. Leading busier lives combined with less free time leads to an expectation for tasks to be done as quickly as possible, in order to make time for those tasks which are enjoyable. Unlike the issue of longer work hours, however, the amount of tasks to complete can be pared down if we wisely prioritise what really matters in our lives.

"Many people are against  Fashion saying it has bad impacts. While, others who favour, opine that it  improves quality of life. I intend to delve into both arguments and present my view.

To begin with, Opponents of fashion argue about  the loss of cultural values and the decrease in the wearing of traditional dresses occurring day by day. In Indian society, For instance, wearing short dresses by women is not a part of the culture but the new generation follows Western trends so elder people mostly feel worried about the future of their traditions. Moreover, it brings people towards consumerism. Individuals buy clothes  for a while  just to show off and then they do not repeat it. Because new thing arrives in the market which allures them.

On the other hand, Fashion brings developments in clothing.Nowadays, people prefer comfortable clothes so designers always try to bring material which is easy to wear and flexible for body movement. For instance, the invention of stretchable cloth occurred following the trend of sportswear in youngsters. Also, there are some clothing brands in the market that are dedicated towards traditional clothing and they  flourished in the market with improved versions of cultural dresses. For example, Saree is a dress from INDIA but it is so famous around the world and sold by many brands across the world.

It's clear that electronic devices not only gives children a better way to entertain themselves, but also have a huge benifit to children.

"In recent years rather than being well-informed about the details of newly launched products, people are bombarded with all kinds of advertisements. I believe the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers and there are some measures which can protect them.

The increasing prevalence of advertising exerts several detrimental effects on consumers. First, commercials might stimulate people to purchase products that they do not really need. In order to approach prospective customers and create brand awareness, many enterprises tend to exaggerate the quality of their products. As a result, unwary consumers who are swayed by glamorous advertisements are easily tempted to impulsively buy goods that are of little use to them. Second, the rising popularity of advertising can also encourage people to form bad habits. For example, as youngsters are not mature enough to distinguish right from wrong or judge what is suitable within society, they might become addicted to playing video games if they are exposed to commercials promoting those products on a frequent basis.

There are several approaches that should be taken into consideration to protect consumers from the adverse effects of advertising. Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry. Under stringent control, most businesses would be more responsible and truthful in promoting their products whether through online advertisements or commercial advertising on prime-time television. This would enable consumers to choose the most suitable and reliable products with greater trust and confidence. Additionally, consumers should have a thorough plan of what they are going to buy before they shop. By doing this, people will have time to prepare and make a wise decision about what products should be bought, which eventually save a great deal of money spent on unnecessary advertised goods.

"Nowadays, many NGOs (Non-government organizations) promote community services by inviting people from all walks of life. Some people believe that number of youth participation is discouraging yet, therefore, they should be compelled to take part in such activities during their leisure. In this essay, I will explain why I completely agree with this idea. 

In modern times, most children have sedentary lifestyles in their free time. Given the instant gratification from social media, Netflix-like applications, and other multimedia gadgets, the youth, now, is more incompassionate about society as a whole. While involved in welfare work, they develop empathy and awareness regarding the problems faced by the world. Voluntary services in an environmental organization, for instance, can help a youngster to learn the impacts of global warming, and contemporary precautionary measures can make the world a safer place for the next generations. Similar opportunities can make a person a good human being and a compassionate member of society.

On the other hand, working for a voluntary organization can harness a youngster with life skills. Take fundraising activity as an example. Such an activity for a charity can help learn money matters such as finance management. Apart from real-life learning,  mention of such an experience in a CV would add value, thus, a brighter chance of earning employment. Indeed, welfare and charity works have a knock-on effect on an individual's life.

Clearly, being a volunteer is not only advantageous for society but also literates an individual at younghood to become a responsible and considerate citizen.",7.5,7.5,7.5
"In recent years, the concept of the phenomenon has become widespread, referring to people who have become famous for their lifestyle. Sometimes the youth try to pretend to be like them. To my mind, it may have several negative consequences.

It is a simple supply-demand pattern, in which they try to provide the audience with something more required. Unfortunately, youngsters prefer glamorous celebrities instead of talented ones. Those who come to the agenda with their scandalous and rich lives are in the spotlight. For example, the Kardashian family has not any specific achievements; however, for a showy lifestyle, they have a huge following. They make unnecessary expenses and take part in meaningless events. This could be a bad example for teenagers who take them as role models. When the life they want is not offered, they can become depressed and, worse, rebel against their families or can behave inappropriately. 

In fact, some celebrities are often found in smoking advertisements, charged with drugs and other criminal activities. A young person who chooses this kind of famous person as an idol will be able to damage their health. Another example can be the impact of a particular celebrity's bad roles in films or series. For instance, Sanjay Dutt, Bollywood Actor is well known for his money and roles as a villain, his terrorist acts in different movies have given rise to violence and crime in the streets of Mumbai, all these were committed by adolescents for thrill and adventure.

In brief, because of the information age, children and adolescents are informed by watching TV, using social networks, and can follow celebrities on these platforms as their role models. If the younger generation is not properly guided, such things can have bad effects on them.",7.5,6.5,6.5
"Nowadays, the preferences of many people are increasing constantly regarding the historical background of their residence. This essay will explain  the causes and the method that they use searching in the following paragraphs.

There are two reasons for this phenomenon. First of all, they believe in faith in terms of religion. Most groups in Thailand are always interested in the places for avoiding the bad situation that goes against the traditional belief. For example, the position of the spirit house is the important rule of the building particularly in Buddhism, they will not be able to relocate automatically. Secondly, they are aware of the safety of their place. A few places might be established for a while and have not ever had any maintenance. As a result, they can perceive that information and find better materials or equipment to fix it as soon as possible.

There are many methods of discovering historical backgrounds. The primary one is questioning the neighbours. In many cases, these people have known the root information because they have been living there for a long time. Furthermore, they are able to examine the public record including the blueprint of the structure and the person who is the latest owner from the supervisor directly. These data can be  reliable and clear evidence to understand the related history. In other words, they could search by resources such as on the internet or  the library. This method will help them to know wider information in a limited time.

In conclusion, humans want to know the background of their living because of some belief to do the appropriate management and security through asking the people in the neighbourhood and checking from trustworthy resources",9.0,6.0,6.0
"It has been observed that the youth take a gap from the study after completion of their schooling instead of getting admission at the University. There are several betterments and detriments for such a situation, both aspects are discussed further.

Discussing the benefits of the mentioned situation, the prime reward is that the young guns can learn about the culture. By this I mean that, as students roam around the world during their break, they will learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. Therefore, their approach changes towards their life as well as become a multilingual person. Moreover, students get a practical experience while doing a part-time job. In other words, pupils learn about maintaining financial condition, enhance their knowledge about businesses as well as find their choice for further studies. For example, the admission department from the  University of Pennsylvania conducted a survey and stated that by having all the above-mentioned abilities, it helps students to have an exceptional result in their studies compared to the other scholar.

Despite the benefits, there are a few repercussions for such scenario. The foremost reason is that students lose momentum. To explain this, the information in their head will fade away after taking a year gap from high school. As a result, a learner would suffer from getting knowledge from new curriculum while pursuing their degree education. Furthermore, gap requires precise planning. To elaborate, during this time if they can not find program and job, he/she might be going through serious issues such as anxiety, which might lead them to illegal activities: theft, consumption of drugs and many more.

To sum up, it can be stated that each side the situation has its advantages and disadvantages. It is a fair idea to take a break to find own speciality before choosing a course at the university; however, without executing perfect plan, learners loose focus from their study as well as job.",7.5,6.5,6.5
"Few people assumes that students can perform better in academics when they are engaged in the competitive sports while many believe that competitive sports are not mandadated in schools. This essay shall highlight the the postive effect of playing the competitive in schools and later discuss the why educational institutions are avoiding the extra curriculum activities in their syallabus.

In the one hand, Sports has been always a great activities for the schoolers to engage in the schools apart from academic course. Moreover, the compitiviness in the games can result positive effect in their education. This is to say that, when students get to play a competitive games in the schools from the early age than they can have the oppotunities to learn the sense of competition from the young age which can help to grow their studies. Furthermore, students participating in the games will boost them to become physically, mentally, and emotionally fit which will eventually assist them to improve thier studies. For instance, according the New York times, 60% of the students who participated in the extra curriculum activities have better academics results than non-participating schoolers. 

On the other hand, plethora of people believes that organizing sports competition in the schools can also bring negative results. This is to say that, playing a competitive game is always full of passion and dedication and every players wants to win. However, in the middle of the heated game, it can lead to a fight and aggressive activities which can have a detrimental effects on the audience.

To sum up, sports activities will have a greater effect in the students for the betterment in their academics course as they can be physically and mentally strong and learn the sense of competiton in their early age.",4.5,5.0,5.0
"This day, most people need social media to stay updated with their loved ones and other people. I positively agree with this way to communicate with others.

Nowadays, in this generation we are more in relying more on social media to have a more effective way when it comes to communicating in long-distance relationships even with our loved ones ,unlike the old ways of past generations using email or writing a letter and getting letter  email for about less than a month or worse more than a month in such action drawbacks to the misunderstanding of individuals, much worried to their family far away what her or his condition, and especially to a person who are suffering from an illness they need more emotional support. 

In addition, I am much more pro to social media since this is a new generation and it gives convenience to us. Getting accurate information about other members of the family is going through the easiest way just to call them anytime you want; it is a relief and a better practice of communicating especially for those people who can't go to their family when having a crucial event because of financial status this is the way to reach out and witness what does the real happen.

In my conclusion, in this world there are many positive effects and drawbacks when you use social media since you are the one who used to; you need more responsible on how is the proper to use  this and also know the disadvantages  such as ways you can handle it for a long time and help all of us that don't need to worry about the effects and benefits.",5.5,4.0,4.0
"In today's increasingly automated world, the development of cutting-edge technology has become a ubiquitous presence that transformed all aspects of life. While some believe that this trend might exacerbate the social classification due to the exorbitant price of some high-tech devices, others would state that certain innovations are available for everyone in  society and help narrow the gap between rich and poor individuals. This essay will thoroughly analyse both sides of the argument before my personal perspective is provided. 

On the one hand, it is reasonable for some to believe that a multitude of automation advancements could put more pressure on those from a lower socio-economic background due to their unaffordability. Iphones from the brand Apple, as an illustration, draw consumers' attention with their constant model upgrades for an average of every  year. In order to keep up with the new trends, middle to high-income employees have increased the competition in purchasing these advancements with a belief that their self-esteem is associated with possessions. In other words, owning these products can create a shining image for their users, giving them an aura of confidence and prosperity when appearing in public. Individuals who could not meet the expense of recent machinery are traumatized by the fear of losing respect among their peers as a consequence, they would approach  mechanisation and computers ownerships by any means possible, whether by working long hours or even turning into crime. 

 On the other hand, others might argue that certain functional technological gadgets, regardless of their range can result in an incline of accessibility of students from all ages and backgrounds to education. It is now simpler than ever for consumers to gain more profound insights into various fields as well as facilitate  well-rounded knowledge and skills for a promising future.

"These days, schools shouldn't taught the students about any skills they only should taught them the academic success and passing examination. So, some people agree with that idea. while, others disagree with that. In this essay i will discuss both sides and i will draw my personal conclusion.

On the one hand, if i agree with that i have some reasons. First of all, the family and friends should do that to make a strong relationship because they will spend over times together. Moreover, they will feel comfortable when they do the skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork because they will do that in some place they love it instead of school. Although, they will be exciting to finish that because they work with people they love them besides, they will have a lot of momert to remember in future.

On the other hand, also if i disagree with that idea i have a lot of reasons. First, definitely school should focus on academic success and passing examinations but also they should make class for student to learn some skills, if they do that the student will love go to school. In addition, the teachers will have more experience about skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork than family and friends and that will help the students to learn faster. However, the students spend may be 6-7 hoursin per day in school and that making them feel boring but if they practice some skills they will feel great and don't prefer about time they spend it there.

In conclusion, after analysis both view, I believe that the both of family and school should taught the student the different skills. Moreover, i agree with tgat because the students spend half the day in school also in home and that helping them to practice very well the skills. Although, i think also the government should make class for the teachers and parents how they teach the students about cookery or dreemaking and woodworks. Also, that great for economy will be higher because all people will join there.",4.5,4.0,4.0
"It is undeniable that many accommodations such as houses in some countries were built for a long time. As the result, many persons are becoming interested the history of the house or building they live in, and they want to find out about their residential. From my point of view, I think that they have many reasons that made them interested in the house history, and they also have many methods to find out. In the following paragraph, the reasons to support my opinion will be outlined in the detail. 

It is true to say that one of the major reasons of finding out about the history of their accommodation is that people are often afraid the house they live in had been robbed or someone had died. Additionally, people consider safety of the accommodations they stay in because if the building were built for a long time, they should maintain it before they move in. For example, many persons in Thailand modern society are often searching some information about the building before they make the decision to buy or rent due to they consider the problems which will come later. 

In addition, people have the different methods to find out about the structure history. For instance, Internet service has used the maximum to search some information about their building due to it is easily to access with everyone, and asking some neighbours who stay for a long time before they move in is also a good way. 

In conclusion, fear and safety are the factors that lead people to start researching the history of their homes. Therefore, it is recommended that finding out about the history of the house is an important thing that everybody should do before the decision to move in.",5.5,6.0,6.0
"It is argued that the lack of accommodations in metropolitans can result in serious impacts and in order to tackle those problems, government action is the only choice. In my opinion, I totally agree with the statement for the following reasons. 

To start with, many people suppose that individuals can offer aid by creating and setting up their own houses which are fully attached with amenities. However, I believe this is a short-sighted view. To make this clear, a person can afford the money to purchase or even construct a shelter to live in but they can not guarantee the quality of the materials for the structures. For instance, in 2019, a family consisting of 5 members in a small village of Hokkaido - Japan managed to create a house made of bricks and woods on their own. Even though it was well-designed with plenty of decorations and furniture, eventually the house collapsed and took away the lives of the whole family. Due to their deaths, the police found out that the system of their house was not strong enough to handle and resulting in a tragedy. Thus, there is a high risky chance to deal with this problem alone.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that the solutions to this issue could be undertaken by the government. The authorities always prior the safety of citizens first so they often provide the basic facilities for them. To address this, many high-rise blocks, skyscrapers,...etc which solve people’s housing have been completed. One of the best examples of this would be in the USA, the government has witnessed the booming population and responded to the inhabitants by devising plans to make buildings that could house people. Additionally, those buildings can ease the traffic for the commuters and facilitate the community’s lives but also the most important thing is that still remains the quality of the structures. Besides, by resolving all the housing issues, more and more people will definitely move in from the urban areas to seek opportunities. ",8.5,7.0,7.0
"Upon graduating from high school, teenagers are likely confused about whether they should pursue higher education or not. Many people believe that getting a tertiary education will be the best way to guarantee a successful career, whereas others believe that starting a job right after school is a better choice.

Working straight after graduation has some advantages. Firstly, they can quickly earn money to make ends meet so that they are no longer dependent on their parents. This may help them be more confident than other people who choose to go to university or college. Secondly, they can absolutely obtain a lot of real experience and learn many important soft skills early. Thus, they could explore more about themselves to find out what field they are interested in and do their best in that.

On the other hand, there are a variety of reasons why people tend to continue to study to get a bachelor’s degree or even a master’s degree after high school. First, the occupation which they want to do requires a high-level education qualification such as doctors, engineers, and astronauts. Furthermore, this option can help them to get a competitive salary or to be likely promoted to a higher position in some corporations. Although this choice may make it more difficult for them in terms of making ends meet during university or college time, they are going to have worthy achievements if they do their best.

In conclusion, it is likely obvious that both working right after high school and pursuing higher education have their own unique advantages.",7.5,7.0,7.0
"Nowadays, people are more and more interested in the historical records of places where they live or will going to live in the future because of their curiosity and a lot of other motives that need to know. In this essay, I will examine the reasons why they are doing this and which appropriate ways are the best to find information about their dwelling's history.

    Firstly, people have enthusiasms for wanting to know about their accommodations past owners out of curiosity as the nature of the human. Secondly, most of them investigate about criminal activities or paranormal activities that happened or not in the surrounding areas of their buildings or houses before they buy, in order to get a safe and nice environment. Also, everybody wants to get kind and friendly neighbors so it is also a great idea to do the history check of the apartments or buildings before living in. Lastly, people want to know which historical famous buildings or places might have been built upon their places.

    There are many ways to research about the historical data of buildings and apartments these days. The easiest way is searching or browsing on the internet through various websites. But rather than relying on online information that anyone can post, asking from local elders that lived long enough to know the history of the building will be more accurate and correct. Moreover, building structures, blueprints, and materials that are used to build can be asked from the construction company that built the building.

    In conclusion, people becoming interested in historical records of the places they live in is a great trend by observing from the above reasons. By knowing this, people can avoid the places that are not suitable for them and they can be proud of their places if they found out when those have some great historical values",6.0,6.5,6.5
"It is hard to deny that the internet is still a new-born technology compared to paper and books which have existed for hundreds of years. Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that keeping knowledge on the internet has many drawbacks. However, as far as economy, environment and educational standards are concerned, I strongly hold that we benefit more from information that is put on the internet. 

First and foremost, storing knowledge on the internet could increase public educational standards as information can be spread more easily over the internet. To be more specific, you can store as much as information you want on the internet and all of it can be checked on any electronic device as long as it is accessible to the internet, there is no constraint on location or time. While the more knowledge is contained in a book, the thicker and heavier it will be. And people can only access the knowledge in that book if they buy or borrow it. Thus, it would be much more convenient to share and spread knowledge through the internet as people are more willing to store and access information on the internet.  

Furthermore, the fact that keeping information on the internet does not require the use of paper indicates that it is very eco-friendly. Take the case of my friend as an example, who shifted the way of studying last year. Starting from then, he made all his notes on a laptop and read electronic books instead of real books. As a result, his personal consumption of paper has declined by over 95%. Therefore, storing knowledge on the internet enables people to reduce their usage of paper, which could save large amounts of water in paper production as well as prevent deforestation to some extent. 

However, a voice arises that storing information on the internet prevents poor people from accessing knowledge as they might find it hard to afford electronic devices. This viewpoint ignores the reality that smart phones have already become a neces",5.0,7.5,7.5
"Numerous factors contribute to engaging people in their work or business. It is argued that money is one of the most important factors to motivate people while others are of the view that self-satisfaction and health are far more crucial rather than money. I agreed with the fact that money is one of the vital factors to motivate people to stay focused and active.

Motivation is the need of the hour for many individuals to stay focused and attentive toward their business or job. This motivation can largely be drawn from the money he/she earned. Since everyone needs money in one way or other to fulfill the basic needs of daily life and to transform his/her lifestyle. Similarly, many multinational entities tend to attract or engage their employees by offering yearly Bonuses, cash prizes, and appreciation tokens. People all around the world travel to different cities and countries in search of a good job and ultimately to earn enough money to enjoy life.

Mental health and self-satisfaction are deemed as crucial as money. Therefore, money should not come at the cost of health and other disturbing factors. Furthermore, the extent of motivation depends upon the individuals since some people achieve motivation through money while other needs appreciation. Similarly, peoples prefer family and friends gathering over extra money or extra earnings. Such peoples draw motivation from their families or friends. Work environment and task completion are amongst the attributes that play their part in motivation.

To sum up, money is the principal factor while attracting people to the workforce or business. However, family, health, and social life should not be compromised 

for the sack of money.",5.5,6.5,6.5
"It is believed that going to a higher education is the finest way to have a successful career, but there is an opposing statement that said getting a job after finishing high school is better. This essay agrees that attending  university or college is more appealing than finding a career.

It is crucial to acknowledge that people tend to be specialized in a particular sector. The Industrial Revolution has made an enormous impact on the way humanity works with information. Therefore, more and more organizations want to specify  their products. In order to get qualified and pursue a financially viable career, degrees and certifications are needed to step into a high-medium level and more company. Furthermore, with a ,qualification we can get another chance without starting all over again. When we have achieved a certain standard and do not want to continue the course due to some reasons, we can always take 1 step back and choose the alternate which is more suitable and comfortable for you.

There is a number of people who argue that experience is far more vital than bachelor's degrees. Experience and enthusiasm can also play an imperative role in selecting  prospective employment. For instant, barber is one of the trending jobs in Vietnam, while servicing is the priority of the job, people tend to go to an older and well-known shop. Another point worth mentioning is that study further costs immensely in both financial and time. While studying and attending expensive courses, other people might earn a salary and get experience which will be essential for their job security and promotion.

It is the writer opinion that finding a job and earning financially is good right after graduating, it is too risky for a long term because the brand could replace you with a younger and more productive worker and pay them less. Although experience is needed, fundamental knowledge about the major sector is important too.

"While it is often argued by some people that youngsters are more responsible in the current era, whereas  others take the view that  many young people are more attentive in the old days. My opinion is that it is better to hold much responsibility  nowadays.

On  one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that children grow with less responsibility. The major reason for believing this is that laziness. This is due to  they spend more time with social media such as  Facebook, Twitter and  Tumbler. Furthermore, it urges them to check their cell phone  frequently and  this leads to lack of helping others. Another reason is that children's are really careless when they do daily activities For example, a child aged between 8 to 12 years are less attentive in their work.  

Despite the above arguments, I hold the position that young people are more responsible.   Indeed, one reason why I take this position is that they are focused in the field of education. Since  the education system in the  modern era is  highly competitive  and they were facing many difficulties to study. However, it is my opinion that kids show respect to their elders in the family. To illustrate, the New York Times  publishes an article about the responsibilities of children at a young age which surge  from the year 2019 to 2020.As a result, the bonding between both are very strong and brings more happiness in the family.

In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that youngsters show more responsibility. This is because education is most important  and in addition to family bonding. Given this situation, it is recommended that the government around the world should think about implementing this form of encouragement through  online media.",9.0,5.5,5.5
"It is true that stricter punishments will deter many motorists from driving dangerously   or carelessly on the roads. However, I strongly disagree that this is the only way to   improve road safety, because there are alternative measures which would also be   effective.  Stricter punishments will undoubtedly act as a deterrent, so that motorists will think   twice before committing traffic offenses. It is often forgotten that motoring offenses   are, in fact, crimes. The full weight of the law should be applied in imposing a range   of non-custodial sentences, such as heavy fines, and the confiscation of driving   licences. The letter of the law must be strictly implemented, banning offenders from   the roads so they will no longer pose a danger to other road-users, including   pedestrians. Those who drive while intoxicated should serve a prison sentence, as   is sometimes imposed in the UK, because they endanger innocent lives.  While harsh penalties for offenders should be high on the government agenda, there   are other steps which national and local authorities should take to improve road safety. Firstly, installing speed cameras has made drivers aware of the need to   adhere to speed limits. Many authorities around the world have adopted this very   cost-effective measure. Secondly, traffic calming measures have succeeded in   reducing the number of accidents, especially in built-up areas. Finally, it is necessary   to adopt a policy of conducting regular vehicle inspections, at authorised centres, to   avoid accidents caused by mechanical failures.  In conclusion, in order to improve road safety, it is not enough to be tough on traffic   crimes by punishing more harshly those who violate the law. A range of road safety   measures should accompany harsher driving penalties.",4.5,8.0,8.0
"It is argued that increasing fuel costs for personal vehicles would be the most optimal solution to today’s environmental issues. To a certain extent, I agree with this idea given that it would discourage people from using such means of transport. However, other more serious problems should still be addressed.

On the one hand, one clear result of rising fuel prices is that people would be more reluctant to pay for them. Since it is common for motorcycles nowadays to have gas tanks that need to be filled up every other day, the higher price tag means constant refuelling is rather unsustainable, which is essentially the case for most people. Consequently, they will be likely to turn to other more affordable means of transport such as buses or bicycles, which release significantly fewer amounts of emission. This will have an enormously positive effect on the overall air quality and help with this particular aspect of the environment.

On the other hand, as much as some would become hesitant when fuel cost rises, others who can afford it would still prioritize comfort and convenience over environmental causes. This is especially prevalent among car owners. Having spent a fortune on their vehicle, they would then find it extremely difficult to give it up. Moreover, there are more severe problems that directly worsen the environment on a larger scale, namely toxic waste from factories dumped into rivers and streams as well as uncontrolled deforestation from individuals to reap personal gains. It is, therefore, vital that we shift our focus to these matters to ensure an overall better outcome for the environment.

In conclusion, I partly agree with the notion that it is best to make fuel costs more expensive to reduce personal vehicles used to tackle environmental issues. Yet, at the same time, actions should be taken against other problems that have a more considerable impact on this matter.",8.5,7.5,7.5
"With rapid development of technology, people nowadays using the internet in various way. This essay will discuss factors contributing to this trend about store knowledge in the internet rather than books and why I think it is a good thing.

There are several reasons I suggest to store knowledge online brings many benefits. Firstly,people may solve their problem conveniently and immidiately by just searching the internet. It even being a common phrase that ""If you have question, just google it"", the only thing what people need to do, is snap their question on mobile application or laptop then they can find the answer easily.

Secondly,  it made a good method to develope education system in rural area or the third countries. Many years ago children may need buy expensive books for their studies in schools, but nowadays as this copies of lesson's materials are storaged on crowd, enhencing young communities who live in an inconvinient enviroment to get knowledge in a easiler , cheaper way.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages if people store knowledge on internet, as much as information released online even what things actually are wrong, people may believe this wrong information easily if they are lack of avidence to support the truth. Therefore people suggested the government should build up a group to identify these information are true or wrong when those spreaded online.

As discussed aboved, nowadays people can grab the knowledge from internet so easily, it caused by new edge technology,x Although it may bring people to know something acutally not true, but peosonally I think it is controlable so I belive it is a good trend.",4.0,5.5,5.5
"It is believed by some people that driving vehicles are the first choice when they go out. Others, on the contrary, think that riding bicycles are prioritised. This essay will introduce reasons of the trend and give my opinions.
Travelling by bikes have two advantages.Firstly,it is good for our health. The bicycle is an environment-friendly transportation as it never needs fuel, which causes no pollutants in the air. As the result, the risk of several diseases may be decreased. Secondly, Riding bicycles will save time in short distance route. There are always a large number of vehicles on the roads, especially during the rush hours in the big cities such as New York and Beijing. Instead of driving cars, riding bikes significantly reduce the traffic congestion and help residents save a lot of time in commuting.
It is also reasonable as why cars are popular in some cities. It is widely known that driving is more efficient, particularly in long distance journey. Nowadays, more and more people would like to broaden views and explore new things by tourism. Comparing with the bikes, cars which do not require a lot of energy from travellers and are much faster can save a lot of time and give explorers more opportunities to views more places and scenery. 
In conclusion, in my mind, both approaches have their own pros and cons. There is no good or bad choice, It all depends on personal preference. Cycling can not only curb the carbon emissions but also help people in keeping both physical and mental health. Meanwhile, cars, in developing countries, can give people higher social status and provide a more efficient way for people to achieve the destination.",7.0,6.5,6.5
